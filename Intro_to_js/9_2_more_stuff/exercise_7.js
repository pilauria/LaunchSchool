/*
Exception handling is a proces that deals  in a manageable and predictable way with errors that could arise in a program.and
Instead of halt the execution if the program find an error, we can put exception to some reules so that it can be executed till the end anyway.
We can write try/catch statement so that the program can handle exception and prevent failure or bugs.
